# Photography_contest_fb_app
This is a fb app to automate a photography contest on fb fane page. Users will upload their info &amp; image. &amp; according to likes, it will be categorized. This app was developed on my 3rd semester. As I didn't have any prior knowledge on version control system, I simply used a conventional way to make the fb app. The code was uploaded on a free domain (000webhost) &amp; i used filezilla to edit my source codes.
But since I used '000webhost.com' a long time ago, they pulled my account down & my exact source code is gone. I was stupid as I had no other back up of my codes.
Thus I'm uploading a pseudo source code here...
The app was mainly web based, which I fetched into the facebook iframe. I just had to connect my website to fb iframe.
My main challenge was- this app was integrated into a facebook fanpage. So Any user could access the app only when they LIKE that fb fanpage.
